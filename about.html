            <h3>My Personal Background</h3>
            <p>
              I'm <em>Walid Yusuf</em>, a passionate web development student at
              Dallas College. My avatar, <strong>Nova</strong>, the "Code
              Weaver," embodies my curiosity and drive to master the digital
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to work as a web developer in a tech company, combining
              creativity and problem-solving skills. Like Nova, who spins
              complex webs of code, I'm committed to building engaging websites
              that make an impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, playing video
              games, and spending time with my family. I'm excited to continue
              my journey in web development and see where it takes me.
